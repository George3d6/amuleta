# Amuleta

_Amuleta_ is a traditional roguelike, featuring a ten-level dungeon, and a
simplified stat system. It is intended to be a _coffeebreak roguelike_, so
that a complete play session may take up to half an hour.

In _Amuleta_, you must guide an adventurer through the dungeon of Amuleta,
and retrieve the Amulet of Light, a powerful artifact said to illuminate the
mind of its wielder.
